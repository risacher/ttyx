wouldn't start on grackle because the default geometry wasn't set in
~/.ttyx/config.json

Should set the default for that somewhere in the code.

Mucked with the code to compute size on maximize() in main client to
avoid pesky scrollbars on the overall page from covering the maximized
window.

Reverted to canvas renderType (or whatever is the default) which seems
to work ATM.  (updated xterm.js recently, so maybe that's okay.)

Terminal is underlining things when it shouldn't be.

Reconnect does not work properly with socket.io v2 (if it ever did.)
I attempted to add some debug code on risacher.org, to at least log to
console when a reconnect attempt is happening.  But there's nothing in
the server-side code that reconnects a client to the terminal?  Maybe
this happens by magic? i.e. if the client reconnects and tries to sync
to existing terminals.

(Actually, it's in the sync() code.)

And the client-side code reconnects, but it destroys all the terminals
when it does.  (fixed?)

I don't like the fact that the term Ids are apparently the pty
filenames.  That seems like a security problem...  if I connect to
ttyx, and manually change the term id, can I hijack a terminal?  I
think the terms IDs should be opaque. [FIXED!]
